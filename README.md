# Employee Retention Project Dashboard
Here is my 1st project which shows the details about Employee Retention releted to HR Domain.
The data used in this project includes 2 excel files with 50k plus records each 
     
Tools used-  EXCEL for data cleaning, MYSQL for analyzing data and TABLEAU for visualization in this project.

Tableau Public Dashboard- [Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pratibha.verma/viz/HRanalyticsdashboard_16545822644250/MainDashboard) 
#### TABLEAU DASHBOARD - 

I have drawn 6 KPI to understand the reason behind attrition and to tackle it.
and got some insights regarding attrition of employees with respect to department, monthly income, work life balance, years of promotion etc.

1 Average Attrition rate for all Departments    
2 Average Hourly rate of Male Research Scientist    
3 Attrition rate Vs Monthly income stats    
4 Average working years for each Department  
5 Job Role Vs Work life balance  
6 Attrition rate Vs Year since last promotion relation    


Its a HIGHLY INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD with GO TO SHEET option including direct navigation to SUB DASHBOARD and filters.
#### *(There is a navigation button(arrow shaped) to direct navigate into subdashboard of that KPI And to only see information regarding a perticular entity of any KPI we can directly click into the chart)

Numbering is proveded to easily understand about all KPI in details.

Talking about the 1st KPI which is-

#### 3.Attrition rate Vs Monthly income stats   
We can see in the chart that Maximum salary hike is for 20-30k salary bin, and Max attrition is from 40-50k salary bin That may be because they are getting better salary
      option in other company for the same work, again going to subdashboard for more information

#### 4 Average working years for each Department

Average working year for Sales department is highest and for R&D department its lowest,But sales dept. has the lowest salary hike.  this indicates we have to work on R&D department.
